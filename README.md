In response to GMA Network's introduction of AI-generated sportscasters in 2023, this project explored how Filipino netizens reacted to the development. The use of AI in broadcast media sparked significant online discussion, particularly on social media platforms like Facebook.

A text corpus of 21,000 Facebook comments was collected from posts related to GMAâ€™s AI sportscasters. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used to examine public discourse, identify common themes, and gauge overall sentiment.
